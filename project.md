# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Product:** ScrollOff ‚Äî Break the Reflex Loop  
**Version:** MVP v2.0 (Enhanced with Behavioral Intelligence)  
**Date:** October 19, 2025 (America/Toronto)  
**Owner:** You (Founder)  
**Prepared for:** AI Coding Agent / Small Dev Team  

---

## 0. Executive Summary
ScrollOff eliminates mindless doomscrolling by **intercepting reflex app opens** and **rewarding real-world focus** with limited "scroll windows." Users mark distraction apps (e.g., Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.), which remain **locked by default.** They **earn credits** by staying scroll-free or completing short focus sessions; these credits unlock distraction apps for a fixed duration before auto-locking again.

**What's New in v2.0:**
- **Intelligent notification handling** prevents users from missing important messages
- **Habit pattern recognition** reveals when impulses strike most
- **Intent logging** deepens behavioral awareness
- **Contextual auto-bypass** reduces friction for legitimate use cases
- **Credit management system** prevents hoarding and encourages healthy usage

The app is built with **cross-platform parity** in mind ‚Äî Android MVP first (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose), followed by iOS (Swift + SwiftUI) using Apple's **Screen Time APIs (DeviceActivity / ManagedSettings)**. Shared logic will be built using **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM)** to ensure consistent behavior across both platforms.

**MVP Outcome:**  
A reliable, battery-friendly app that:
1. Intercepts launches of selected apps intelligently
2. Handles notifications without full app unlocks
3. Grants time-boxed unlocks based on earned credits
4. Re-locks on expiry with smart context awareness
5. Displays streaks, patterns, and behavioral insights
6. Adapts to user context (time, location, calendar)

---

## 1. Problem, Goals, Non-Goals
### 1.1 Problem
People reflexively open "scroll apps" dozens of times a day ‚Äî not by choice, but by habit. Existing blockers either over-restrict (causing frustration) or require manual activation (which users forget). They also fail to account for legitimate notifications and context, leading to abandonment.

ScrollOff bridges the gap by combining **behavioral awareness** with **reward-based discipline** while respecting the user's real-world needs.

### 1.2 Goals (MVP v2.0)
- **G1:** Reduce reflex app opens by **‚â•50%** within 14 days.
- **G2:** Achieve **‚â•70%** intercept acceptance rate (Skip/Earn vs Scroll Anyway) by week 2 (increased from 60%).
- **G3:** Keep **battery overhead <3%/day**.
- **G4:** Reach **Day-7 retention ‚â•50%** (increased from 40%).
- **G5:** **‚â§5% notification-related bypasses** in week 1 (new metric).
- **G6:** Users discover **‚â•1 pattern insight** within 7 days (new metric).

### 1.3 Non-Goals (MVP)
- No AI chatbot or productivity planner.
- No full-screen blockers or VPN-based controls.
- No browser or desktop extension (future phase).
- No social leaderboards (1-on-1 accountability only in Phase 1.5).

---

## 2. Users & Personas
- **Busy Builder (25‚Äì40):** Constantly context-switching, opens socials between work tasks. Wants gentle accountability without missing work notifications.
- **Student (16‚Äì24):** Procrastinates with short, frequent scrolls. Wants game-like streaks and understanding of when they're weakest.
- **Professional Parent (30‚Äì45):** Wants reduced distraction without cutting off critical apps like calls, messaging, or family coordination apps.

**New Consideration:** All personas need **notification-aware blocking** to avoid feeling "locked out" of important communications.

Accessibility-first: large tap targets, readable typography, high contrast, and screen reader labels.

---

## 3. Core Concepts & Definitions
- **Watched Apps:** User-selected distraction apps. Locked by default.
- **Intercept:** Overlay (Android) or Shield (iOS) shown when a watched app launches.
- **Credits:** Units earned by staying scroll-free or completing focus sessions. **Max cap: 180 minutes** to prevent hoarding.
- **Credit Decay:** Credits older than 48 hours expire at 50% rate to encourage regular usage.
- **Unlock Window:** Temporary duration where watched apps are usable.
- **Slip:** A recorded event when user overrides an intercept.
- **Notification Peek:** 2-minute mini-unlock granted when user clicks a notification from a watched app.
- **Intent Tag:** User-selected reason for opening an app (Bored, Checking notification, Looking for something, Habit).
- **Pattern Insight:** AI-detected trend in user behavior (e.g., "Most slips happen after 8pm").
- **Context Rule:** Time/location/calendar-based auto-bypass condition.

---

## 4. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### US-1: Mark distraction apps
**As a** user, **I want** to choose which apps are controlled **so that** only those distractors are gated.
- **AC1.1:** Can select ‚â•10 apps from suggestions + search installed apps.
- **AC1.2:** App moves under control immediately after toggle.
- **AC1.3:** Can mark certain apps as "notification-safe" (quick peek allowed).

### US-2: Intercept reflex opens
**As a** user, **I want** a nudge when opening a watched app **so I can decide consciously.**
- **AC2.1:** Intercept appears ‚â§250ms after app launch.
- **AC2.2:** Options: **Skip**, **Earn scroll time**, **Scroll once** (with 5-second delay after week 1).
- **AC2.3:** Skip returns to home screen smoothly.
- **AC2.4:** **NEW:** Optional intent tag selection ("Why did you open this?").

### US-3: Handle notifications intelligently
**As a** user, **I want** to respond to notifications without unlocking the full app **so that** I stay connected without falling into scrolling.
- **AC3.1:** Tapping a notification from a watched app shows mini-intercept: "Quick peek (2 min)" or "Full unlock".
- **AC3.2:** Quick peek grants 2-minute access, then auto-locks.
- **AC3.3:** Notification badge previews visible on intercept screen ("3 new messages").
- **AC3.4:** Can enable "smart peek" for specific contacts/keywords (Phase 1.5).

### US-4: Earn-to-unlock
**As a** user, **I want** to earn credits for staying scroll-free **so that** I can unlock apps responsibly.
- **AC4.1:** Default ratio 60 min focus = 20 min unlock (configurable 30‚Äì120 ‚áí 10‚Äì40).
- **AC4.2:** Manual focus sessions (5, 15, 25 min) grant credits.
- **AC4.3:** Unlock windows start on demand; all watched apps open freely until timer ends.
- **AC4.4:** On expiry, apps re-lock automatically.
- **AC4.5:** **NEW:** Max credit cap of 180 minutes displayed prominently.
- **AC4.6:** **NEW:** Credits older than 48h decay by 50% (shown with "expiring soon" badge).

### US-5: Discover habit patterns
**As a** user, **I want** to see when I'm most vulnerable to impulses **so that** I can plan better.
- **AC5.1:** Show heatmap of intercepts by hour of day.
- **AC5.2:** Display insights like "You're strongest 9am-12pm" or "Most slips happen after 8pm".
- **AC5.3:** Track intent tags over time ("You opened Instagram 12 times 'out of boredom' this week").
- **AC5.4:** Weekly summary notification with top pattern.

### US-6: Set contextual rules
**As a** user, **I want** apps to auto-unlock in certain contexts **so that** I'm not blocked during legitimate use.
- **AC6.1:** Time-based rules: "Allow news apps 7-8am only".
- **AC6.2:** Calendar integration: Auto-bypass 10 min before/after events with location/video links.
- **AC6.3:** Location-based (optional): "Unlock YouTube at gym".
- **AC6.4:** High-priority app auto-bypass (camera, maps, ride-sharing) for 10 minutes.

### US-7: Insights & streaks
**As a** user, **I want** visual stats **so that** I can see my progress.
- **AC7.1:** Show daily intercepts, skips, slips, minutes earned/used.
- **AC7.2:** Display scroll-free streaks (days in a row with ‚â•1 skip).
- **AC7.3:** **NEW:** Pattern insights section with top vulnerability times.
- **AC7.4:** **NEW:** Intent breakdown chart.

### US-8: Emergency bypass
**As a** user, **I want** a quick bypass for emergencies **so that** I'm never locked out when needed.
- **AC8.1:** Temporary unlock (e.g., 60 mins) with confirmation.
- **AC8.2:** Event logged in analytics for transparency.
- **AC8.3:** Costs 30 minutes of future credits (prevents abuse).

onAccessibilityEvent(event) {
    if (event.type == TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED) {
        val pkg = event.packageName
        
        // Check context rules first
        if (hasActiveContextRule(pkg)) {
            logEvent(pkg, "CONTEXT_AUTO_BYPASS")
            return  // Don't intercept
        }
        
        if (isWatched(pkg) && !unlockWindow.active) {
            // Check if triggered by notification
            val fromNotification = wasRecentNotification(pkg)
            showOverlay(pkg, fromNotification)
        }
    }
}

fun showOverlay(pkg: String, fromNotification: Boolean) {
    // Show intent tag options
    displayIntentTags()

    }
    
    onEarn {
        startFocusSession()
        log(pkg, "EARN", selectedIntent)
    }
    
    onScrollOnce {
        // Week 1: Immediate
        // Week 2+: 5-second countdown
        if (settings.weekNumber > 1) {
            showCountdown(5.seconds)
        }
        whitelistTemp(pkg, 60.seconds)
        deductCredits(15.minutes)  // NEW: Costs credits

    }
}

// NEW: Credit decay
fun decayCredits() {
    val expiredCredits = creditLedger.findExpired(now())

        0
    }
}
```

## 17. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Credit decay rate:** 50% after 48h is aggressive. Consider 25% after 72h for gentler approach?
   - **Recommendation:** A/B test both; lean toward 25% at 72h for MVP to reduce early friction.

2. **Peek window duration:** 2 minutes may be too short for complex responses. Test 3 or 5 minutes?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with 3 minutes; allow Pro users to configure 2‚Äì10 minutes.

3. **Progressive strictness opt-in:** Should this be default or require explicit activation?
   - **Recommendation:** Default ON with clear explanation during onboarding; allow toggle in settings.

4. **Intent tag requirement:** Should users be required to select an intent, or keep it optional?
   - **Recommendation:** Optional for MVP; encourage via gentle prompts ("Help us learn your patterns?").

5. **Location permission timing:** Ask during onboarding or wait until user tries to create location rule?
   - **Recommendation:** Wait until user attempts to create location rule to reduce permission fatigue.

6. **Calendar auto-bypass window:** 10 minutes before/after event may be too broad. Consider 5 minutes?
   - **Recommendation:** Make configurable (5/10/15 min) in Pro; default 10 min for Free.

7. **Negative credit debt limit:** ‚àí30 minutes may feel punishing. Consider ‚àí15 minutes?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with ‚àí15 min; monitor user feedback and adjust if needed.

## 19. Data Flow Diagrams

### 19.1 Intercept Flow (Enhanced)

```
User taps app icon
       ‚Üì
AccessibilityService detects launch
       ‚Üì
Check: Is app watched? ‚Üí NO ‚Üí Allow launch
       ‚Üì YES
Check: Active unlock window? ‚Üí YES ‚Üí Allow launch
       ‚Üì NO
Check: Context rule active? ‚Üí YES ‚Üí Log + Allow launch
       ‚Üì NO
Check: Recent notification? ‚Üí YES ‚Üí Mark as notification-triggered
       ‚Üì
Show InterceptOverlay
       ‚Üì
User selects intent tag (optional)
       ‚Üì
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí SKIP ‚Üí Close app + Log event
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí PEEK (if notification) ‚Üí Start 3-min window + Log
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí EARN ‚Üí Show focus picker ‚Üí Start focus session
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí SCROLL ONCE ‚Üí Deduct 15 min credits ‚Üí Allow 60s ‚Üí Log
```

### 19.2 Credit Management Flow

## 20. Security & Privacy Deep Dive

### 20.1 Data Storage
- **Location:** Local SQLite database only
- **Encryption:** Android Keystore for sensitive settings
- **Backup:** Excluded from cloud backups by default (user can opt-in)
- **Retention:** User-controlled; default 90 days, then auto-delete old events

### 20.2 Permissions Justification

| Permission | Justification | When Requested |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Accessibility Service | Required to detect app launches and show intercepts | Onboarding |
| Overlay | Required to show intercept UI over other apps | Onboarding |
| Notifications | Optional; enables pattern insights notifications | Onboarding (skippable) |
| Usage Stats | Required for passive credit accrual | Onboarding |
| Notification Listener | Required for notification peek feature | When enabling notification-safe apps |
| Calendar | Optional; enables calendar-based context rules | When creating calendar rule |
| Location | Optional; enables location-based context rules | When creating location rule |

### 20.3 Data We NEVER Collect
- Notification content (only timestamps and counts)
- Actual app usage content (e.g., what you viewed in Instagram)
- Location history (only current location when rule evaluates)
- Calendar event details (only presence of event + video/location flags)
- Analytics sent to external servers (unless user explicitly opts in)

### 20.4 User Control
- **Data Export:** One-tap export to JSON for external analysis
- **Data Deletion:** Permanent delete with confirmation (cannot be undone)
- **Selective Logging:** Can disable intent tagging or pattern analysis
- **Audit Log:** View all intercept actions taken in past 30 days

---

## 21. Performance Optimization Strategies

### 21.1 Battery Optimization
- Use WorkManager for non-critical background tasks (pattern analysis)
- Leverage Doze mode exemptions carefully (only for CreditAccrualService)
- Batch database writes (max 1 write per minute)
- Cache context rule evaluations (re-evaluate only on config change)
- Use Foreground Service only when necessary (show persistent notification)

### 21.2 Memory Optimization
- Limit in-memory notification cache to last 20 notifications
- Use Paging3 for insights history (load on demand)
- Lazy load heatmap data (render only visible hours)
- Release overlay resources immediately after dismissal

### 21.3 Intercept Latency Optimization
- Pre-load watched apps list in memory (no DB query on intercept)
- Pre-compute context rule eligibility on config change
- Use Compose for overlay (faster rendering than XML views)
- Target <150ms latency (vs 250ms requirement) for premium feel

---

## 22. Accessibility Requirements

### 22.1 Screen Reader Support
- All buttons have contentDescription labels
- Intercept announces: "Impulse detected for [AppName]. Choose an action."
- Credit balance announced as: "You have [X] minutes of unlock time available"
- Pattern insights read aloud with full context

### 22.2 Visual Accessibility
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA)
- Supports system font scaling up to 200%
- No information conveyed by color alone (use icons + text)
- Heatmap has alternative list view for colorblind users

### 22.3 Motor Accessibility
- Minimum 48dp touch targets for all interactive elements
- No gestures required (all actions have button alternatives)
- Adjustable timing for "Scroll once" delay (5-30 seconds)

### 22.4 Cognitive Accessibility
- Clear, simple language (no jargon)
- Consistent button placement across all screens
- Visual progress indicators for focus sessions
- Option to disable complex insights (show simple counts only)

---

## 23. Localization Strategy (Future)

### Phase 1 (Launch)
- English only

### Phase 2 (3 months post-launch)
- Spanish (Espa√±ol)
- French (Fran√ßais)
- German (Deutsch)

### Phase 3 (6 months post-launch)
- Simplified Chinese (ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá)
- Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û)
- Korean (ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥)
- Hindi (‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä)

**Translation Guidelines:**
- Keep tone empathetic and encouraging (avoid literal translations)
- Localize time formats and date displays
- Adapt idioms (e.g., "crushing it" ‚Üí culturally appropriate equivalent)
- Test with native speakers before release
